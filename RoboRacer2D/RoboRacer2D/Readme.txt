interactions between various objects in the game


Collision detection

Boundary detection
• Stop the object
• Allow the object to continue past the border (and therefore, disappear)
• Allow the object to continue past the border and reappear at the opposite border (ever played the arcade version of Asteroids?)
• Scroll the camera and the screen along with the object (aka Mario)
• Allow the object to rebound off the border (ever played Breakout?)
